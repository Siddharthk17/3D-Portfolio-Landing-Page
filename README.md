## 🚀 About The Project

This repository hosts a **cinematic landing page** designed to serve as the entry point for a personal portfolio. It combines modern web technologies with 3D design to create an immersive user experience.

The project focuses on **minimalism**, **typography**, and **interaction**. Instead of a static background, it utilizes **Spline** to render a real-time 3D scene that users can interact with, overlaid with glass-morphic text and smooth CSS animations.

### 🎨 Key Features

*   **Interactive 3D Background:** Integrated using `spline-viewer` for a lightweight, interactive web 3D experience.
*   **Custom Typography:** Features the **'Mars'** font for bold headers and **'JetBrains Mono'** for a clean, developer-centric aesthetic.
*   **Smooth Animations:**
    *   Cascade fade-in effects for text and navigation.
    *   "Sheen" hover effects on navigation links.
    *   Floating scroll indicators.
*   **Responsive Design:** Fully adaptive layouts for Desktop, Tablet, and Mobile devices.
*   **Clean UI:** Script included to seamlessly hide watermarks for a professional look.
